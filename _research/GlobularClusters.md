I have had an interest in Globular clusters since my undergraduate. This started with a LEAPs internship supervised by Dr Alice Zocchi, studying the dynamics of globular clusters to understand what are the main ingredients that shape their properties. The spherical approximation is too simple and so we measured the rotation curve of one system as a possible explanation for the flattening of this globular cluster. 

My third-year research project involved reducing INT data, combined with HST images to study the properties of open and globular clusters using photometry to obtain estimates of their ages and metallicities. The work can be read [here](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/134674/).

My Masters thesis, supervised by Dr David Sobral, involved modelling how present-day Milky Way globular clusters would have looked when they first formed by repopulating the young massive stars and generating mock observational images to test if they are observable at high redshift with HST and JWST. Click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/emma-l-dodd/emma-l-dodd.github.io/blob/master/assets/files/Masters_Thesis_Final.pdf) for a link to my thesis in PDF format.

My PhD research has been focused on the assembly history of the Milky Way and looking for the debris from accreted satellite galaxies, but through this we also identify several smaller streams in the local stellar halo. Some of these present a small spread in metallicity indicative that they could have had a disrupted globular cluster origin.
