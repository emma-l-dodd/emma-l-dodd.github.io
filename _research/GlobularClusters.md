I have had an interest in Globular clusters since my undergraduate. This started with a LEAPs internship supervised by Dr Alice Zocchi, studying the dynamics of globular clusters to understand what are the main ingredients that shape their properties. The spherical approximation is too simple and so we measured the rotation curve of one system as a possible explanation for the flattening of this globular cluster. 

My third-year research project involved reducing INT data, combined with HST images to study the properties of open and globular clusters using photometry to obtain estimates of their ages and metallicities. The work can be read [here](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/134674/).

My Masters thesis, supervised by Dr David Sobral, involved modelling how present-day Milky Way globular clusters would have looked when they first formed by repopulating the young massive stars and generating mock observational images to test if they are observable at high redshift with HST and JWST. Click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/emma-l-dodd/emma-l-dodd.github.io/blob/master/assets/files/Masters_Thesis_Final.pdf) for a link to my thesis in PDF format.

My PhD research has been focused on the assembly history of the Milky Way and looking for the debris from accreted satellite galaxies, but through this we also identify several smaller streams in the local stellar halo. Some of these present a small spread in metallicity indicative that they could have had a disrupted globular cluster origin.

One of these is ED-2, a cold but not-so-narrow stellar stream that crosses the Solar neighbourhood. This stream has an estimated thickness of 130 pc and velocity dispersion of 7.4 km/s with typical uncertainties on position and velocity of 25pc and 5 km/s respectively. The stars in the stream form a tight sequence in the CMD (indicative of a low [Fe/H] spread) and are bluer than the blue MS (very metal-poor). Spectroscopic [Fe/H] from Li et al. (2018) show that the stream stars exhibit a low metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -2.63Â±0.2 and is unlikely to have a known progenitor.

Stay tuned for chemical follow up of these streams.
