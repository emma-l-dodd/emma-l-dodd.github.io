I have had an interest in Globular clusters since my undergraduate. My third-year research project involved reducing INT data and studying the properties of open and globular clusters using photometry to obtain estimates on their ages and metallicities. The work can be read [here](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/134674/).

Merger debris is known to populate the inner stellar halo and is visible as substructure in integrals of motion (IOM) space, e.g. energy and angular momentum. Identifying these over-densities is possible with the use of clustering algorithms.

In this work, we use a single-linkage algorithm, which joins the two closest components together at each step. We apply this in the 3D integral of motion (IOM) space of energy and angular momenta. Our method differs from the regularly used clustering algorithms, where arbitrary decisions have to be made on when to stop linking components together. We do this by assessing the significance of the clusters at each step, comparing the number of stars in the dataset to the number in a smooth artificial halo, within that cluster region. The artificial halo is generated from the dataset by shuffling two components of the velocity to remove the substructure. 

We extract clusters when they reach their maximum significance and then in the next step we link clusters into groups using how close they are in IOM space (with a Mahalanobis distance) and their stellar populations (colour-magnitude diagrams and metallicity distributions). This provides an updated view of the local stellar halo using Gaia DR3 data. We find that the local stellar halo appears to be made up of 7 main groups and a handful of smaller substructures. The majority of these structures have been reported previously but we present an updated catalogue of their members. The catalogue can be found [here](https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/670/L2){:target='_blank'}

Several of the smaller substructures at high energy are new and interesting to follow up. Some of these present a small spread in metallicity indicative that they could have had a disrupted globular cluster origin. Others fall in the region of IOM space where we may expect debris from Gaia Enceladus since the debris from large mergers is known to be complex. Linking the complex debris together allows us to place further constraints on the nature of the Gaia Enceladus merger. Interpreting and characterising the different accretion events further requires the addition of chemical information that will be made more possible with 4MOST and WEAVE.
