Through studying the Milky Way's dynamics, we are able to learn about the structure and dark matter distribution of our galaxy. Our approach to constrain the Milky Way potential using substructure observed in the local Helmi Streams stars. The Helmi streams are the debris of an accretion event that is predicted to have taken place around 8-10 Gyrs ago. The debris from this event should form a single clump in integrals of motion space but we observed a clear split in angular momenta space (proxys for integrals of motion). This can be seen in figure below. We found that the stellar populations of these stars to be consisten with both clumps being of a common origin, therefore the observed substructure is not due to accretion but rather due to evolution of these streams in the Galactic potential. Looking at the orbits of these stars we find that the stars in the higher anagular momentum clump are on a resonant orbit in Phi and Z. Since the angular momenta of the stars is observable and does not depend on the potential we can find the potential that allows for this substructure to remain, keeping the higher angular momenta stars on the resonant orbit. This is the case for a Galactic potential in which the flattening of the dark matter halo is adjusted from spherical q=1 to prolate with q=1.2, where q is the axis ratio of the halo to disk. In this potential the higher angular momenta stars also lie exactly on the 1:1 resonance in Phi and Z. We therefore suggest that within the regions of the probed by the Helmi stream orbits (about 5-20kpc) the dark matter halo has a prolate shape. The Helmi streams are a useful group of stars to constrain the Milky Way potential, due to their peculiar substructure, their position in angular momenta space: without much contamiantion and seperating them from the rest of the halo.
