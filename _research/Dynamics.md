Through studying the Milky Way's dynamics, we are able to learn about the structure and dark matter distribution of our galaxy. Our approach is to constrain the Milky Way potential using substructure observed in the local Helmi Streams stars. 

The Helmi streams are the debris of an accretion event that is predicted to have taken place around 8-10 Gyrs ago. The debris from this event should form a single clump in integrals of motion space but we observed a clear split in angular momenta space (proxies for integrals of motion). This can be seen in the figure below. We found the stellar populations of these stars to be consistent with both clumps being of a common origin, therefore the observed substructure is not due to accretion but rather due to the evolution of these streams in the Galactic potential. Looking at the orbits of these stars we find that the stars in the higher angular momentum clump are on a resonant orbit in Phi and Z. 

Since the angular momenta of the stars is observable and does not depend on the potential we can find the potential that allows for this substructure to remain, keeping the higher angular momenta stars on the resonant orbit. This is the case for a Galactic potential (Mc Millan 2017) in which the flattening of the dark matter halo is adjusted from spherical q=1 to prolate with q=1.2, where q is the axis ratio of the halo to disk. In this potential the higher angular momenta stars also lie exactly on the 1:1 resonance in Phi and Z. 

We, therefore, suggest that within the regions of the halo probed by the Helmi stream orbits (about 5-20kpc) the dark matter halo has a prolate shape. The Helmi streams are a useful group of stars to constrain the Milky Way potential, due to their peculiar substructure, and their position in angular momenta space: without much contamination and separating them from the rest of the halo.
