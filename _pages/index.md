Hello, I am Emma Dodd, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Computational Cosmology in Durham, United Kingdom. I obtained my PhD at the Kapteyn Institute, University of Groningen in 2024 working as part of Prof. Dr. Amina Helmi and Prof. Dr. Else Starkenburg's research groups. I am interested in the assembly history of the Milky Way, utilising both dynamical and chemical information. Gaia data has been revolutionising the field of Galactic Archaeology and we have been utilising the data to study the Milky Way and characterise the accretion events experienced by our galaxy in the past.
