Hello, I am Emma Dodd, a final year PhD researcher at Kapteyn Institute, University of Groningen. I am a part of Prof. Dr. Amina Helmi and Prof. Dr. Else Starkenburg's groups. The topic of my PhD is to research the assembly history of the Milky Way, utilising dynamical and chemical information. Gaia data has been revolutionising the field of Galactic Archaeoalogy and we have been utilising the data to study the Milky Way and characterise the accretion events experienced by our galaxy in the past.
