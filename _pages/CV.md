I am from the North of  England, and I did my combined bachelors and masters, 
MPhys, (Physics with astrophysics and cosmology), at Lancaster University. Here I was heavily involved with the [XGAL research and outreach team](https://xgalweb.wordpress.com).
For my masters, I was supervised by Dr. David Sobral in researching present-day globular clusters 
and modelling their evolution to predict if they would be observable with JWST at high redshift. 

Throughout my undergrad I also worked with high redshift galaxy data; looking at CII 
emission with ALMA data cubes of CR7 and [looking at the evolution of Lyman alpha haloes 
with the SC4K catalogue](https://xgalweb.wordpress.com/lyman-alpha-haloes-across-cosmic-time/). 

My love for globular clusters began when I attended the LEAPs summer school in 2018, 
working with Dr. Alice Zocchi at ESA, ESTEC on the flattening of globular cluster systems.

I completed my PhD at the Kapteyn Institute, Groningen, Netherlands from 2020 -2024 with Prof. Dr. Amina Helmi. My work focused on galactic archaeology, to study the assembly history of the Milky Way
from present-day dynamical and chemical information. My main focus has been on using Gaia 
data to unveil more information on the accretion events experienced by our galaxy in the past. Click [here](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/galactic-ancestry-in-the-gaia-era) for a link to my PhD thesis. 

I am now working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Insitute for Computational Cosmology in Durham, United Kingdom, continuing research into the assembly of the Milky Way.
