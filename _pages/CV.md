I am from the North of  England, and I did my combined bachelors and masters, 
MPhys, (Physics with astrophysics and cosmology), at Lancaster University. 
For my masters, I was supervised by Dr. David Sobral researching present-day globular clusters 
and modelling their evolution to predict if they would be observable with JWST at high redshift. 

Throughout my undergrad I also worked with high redshift galaxy data; looking at CII 
emission with ALMA data cubes of CR7 and looking at the evolution of Lyman alpha haloes 
with the SC4K catalogue. 

My love for globular clusters began when I attended the LEAPs summer school in 2018, 
working with Dr. Alice Zocchi at ESA, ESTEC on the flattening of globular cluster systems.

I began my PhD at the Kapteyn Institute, Groningen in 2020 with Prof. Dr. Amina Helmi. The 
topic of my PhD is galactic archaeology, to study the assembly history of the Milky Way
from present-day dynamical and chemical information. My main focus has been on using Gaia 
data to unveil more information on the accretion events experienced by our galaxy in the past.
